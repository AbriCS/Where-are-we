# Where Are We?
## An Interactive Geography Game
## 0A: Introduction to the Project!
Where Are We? is an interactive geography quiz game. It presents the player with a randomly generated photo of a city, and asks them to guess where they are. The selection of cities and photographs are generated by two APIs, AccuWeather and Unsplash, so every playthrough of the game is a unique experience.

Where Are We? was built by a small team of developers, undertaken as part of the UoB/Trilogy Coding Bootcamp 2021/2022. The purpose of the task was to develop a product using the technical skills we gained during the first 8 weeks of the boot camp. The requirement was to build an app, using HTML, CSS and Javascript, which interacts with two different Server-Side APIs, and all of the web development and design skills we have developed so far on the course.

## 0C: Meet the Team! 
__Jean McLeod: *Scrum Master, Front-End Developer*__ 

Jean took on the organisational lead of the project, introducing us to working with the agile development strategy of project management. She led regular stand ups and tracked our short sprints through Trello. She also took on key work with the HTML and CSS design, taking the lead on the adjustable Settings page and assisting with the design in Figma. 

__Girish Madnani: *Technical Lead, Front-End Developer*__

Girish took lead on bringing the project together, taking on the core responsibility to review and bring together the different parts of the application as a whole. He was also  responsibile for both sourcing and manipulating the APIs used, and building key aspects of the Javascript functionality. 

__Daniel Bowen: *Javascript Developer, Front-End Developer*__

Daniel worked on the functionality of the game, building the core Javascript functions which would create and rebuild the game itself. He worked closely with Girish to incorporate the APIs into this Javascript framework, and took a lead on the ideation of the product itself.

__Sumaya Gure: *CSS Lead, Front-End Developer*__

Sumaya led to the team for creating the layout design, designing and constructing the core CSS the application was built around. She led development of a wireframe model for each of the webpages in Figma, and built the CSS model for the central Gameplay page - the code for which all of the other pages of the game were modelled after.  

__Jibril Yusuf: *HTML Architect, Front-End Developer*__

Jibril took the lead on building the HTML architecture, giving the webpage its overall structure and offering a framework for the rest of the team to build on top of. He also worked with Sumaya and Jean to build the CSS for the entire website, taking the wireframe model and bringing it to life. 
## 0D: Deployed Application
The deployed application can currently be found here: 
https://gmadnani.github.io/Where-are-we/

## 01: Getting Started
### 01C: Project Ideation and User Stories
The key features that we felt users would want us to implement are:
- As a user, I want to test my geographical knowledge, so that I can test it and improve it.
- As a user, I want the the questions to be generatedly randomly, so that every play through of the game is unique.
- As a user, I want to there to be photographs as part of the question, so my visual knowledge and reasoning skills are improved
- As a user, I want to track my score, so that I know if my geographical knowledge is improving as  I play the game.
- As a user, I want an adjustable settings page, so that I can customise the gameplay to suit my needs.


## Getting Started

The following minimum requirements were secured;

- Ideation
- Agile Project Planning Team 
- Pair Programming
- Short sprints
- Regular Stand Ups



```
 *Communication was Key as some tasks ran concurrently. 
 ```


### Initial steps

- Read the Brief
- Clarify the acceptance criteria.
- Log into Github
- Create a new Repository  
- Copy the SSH key to the local computer.
 <p> 
 * This is achieved by clicking the little boxes next to the Git Hub key. See the image below.

- Open the file then type the following;
- **Git clone** then "paste the copied SSH key here"
- Type **Git add** followed by **Git Commit -m'** followed by "the name of the changes made inside the speech marks"

```
clone, add, commit, push, status

## Space for Growth

Our vision is to create a game that can be used both for education and entertainment. We feel that there is a huge capacity for this project to grow, and that using APIs to build a quiz could be extended to test all sorts of trivia and types of knowledge, from marvel movies and actor faces, to historical and scientific knowledge.
## Version History

- <b>0.1  The Latest<b>
    - The first version of the product was presented and demonstrated by the entire team at The Exchange, University of Birmingham on Saturday 12th February 2022.
